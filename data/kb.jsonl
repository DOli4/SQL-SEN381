Clustering •   Clustering Techniques •   K - Means Clustering •   Plot original data points •   Calculating centroids •   Computing Euclidean distances •   Plot clustered points •   Examples   and Exercises\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   3 Introduction •   The organization/segmentation of   unlabeled   data   into similarity groups called   clusters . •   A   cluster   is a collection of data items which are “similar” between them, and “dissimilar” to data items in other clusters.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   4 Historical Application of Clustering • John Snow , a London physician plotted location of cholera deaths on a map during an outbreak in 1850s. •   Locations indicated that cases were clustered around certain around certain intersections where there were polluted polluted wells; • thus

{"id":"LO1_K-means.pdf#1","file":"LO1_K-means.pdf","content":"Clustering •   Clustering is a form of machine learning where groups, or classes,   are not known ahead of time   so groupings are created by looking   at similar and shared characteristics among the things being grouped.   (homogeneous groups) •   Given a set of potential class members, the task of clustering is to establish the existence of two or more classes or clusters in the members. •   These clusters are often determined through trial and error   by grouping   things together by looking for similar features,   analyzing   the results to see how good they are, and repeating this learning process until the groups are deemed   acceptable. •   Clustering   is an example of   unsupervised learning   because   classes are unknown   at the   start.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   7 What do we need for Clustering? •   Required: 1.   Proximity measure. 2.   Criterion function to evaluate a clustering. 3.   Algorithm to compute clustering.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   8 K - Means Clustering •   K - means   ( MacQueen , 1967)   is a   partitional   clustering algorithm. •   Let the set of data points   𝐷

Use the k means algorithm to cluster them.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   25 ( k - means method) Suppose two clusters are to be formed First assign   a ,   b   and   d   to Cluster 1, Next assign   c and e to Cluster 2. Calculate cluster centroids The cluster centroid is the point with coordinates equal to the average values of the variables for the observations in that cluster calculate the distance between   a   and the two centroids: Centroid of Cluster 1 is   the   point (X1 = 3:67, X2 = 3:67), calculate the distance   between   b and the two cluster centroids: Since   b   is closer to Cluster 2's centroid

Quinlan •   Employs a top - down, greedy search through the space of possible branches (Divide and Conquer) •   ID3 uses   Entropy   a nd   Information Gain   to construct a decision tree.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   9 Entropy •   Def: -   Entropy is the   Uncertanity   of information that is contained in an Attribute. •   A decision tree is built   top - down   from a root node and involves partitioning the data into subsets   that contain instances(tables) with similar values ( homogenous ). •   ID3 algorithm uses entropy to calculate the   homogeneity   of a sample. •   If the sample is   completely homogeneous   the   entropy is zero   and; •   If the sample is   equally divided   it has   entropy of one .\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   10 Steps. •   Step 1: -   Calculate the Entropy of the target Attribute   𝐸 ( 𝑆 ) •   Step 2: -   Calculate the Average Entropy of each Predictor Variable   𝐸 ( 𝑆 ,   𝑋 ) •   Step 3: -   Calculate The information Gain   𝐼 ( 𝑆 ,   𝑋 ) •

attributes that have a   smaller number of values . •   These ‘Super Attributes’ will easily be selected as the   root node , resulted in a   broad tree   that classifies perfectly but performs poorly

Clustering •   Clustering Techniques •   K - Means Clustering •   Plot original data points •   Calculating centroids •   Computing Euclidean distances •   Plot clustered points •   Examples   and Exercises\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   3 Introduction •   The organization/segmentation of   unlabeled   data   into similarity groups called   clusters . •   A   cluster   is a collection of data items which are “similar” between them, and “dissimilar” to data items in other clusters.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   4 Historical Application of Clustering • John Snow , a London physician plotted location of cholera deaths on a map during an outbreak in 1850s. •   Locations indicated that cases were clustered around certain around certain intersections where there were polluted polluted wells; • thus

{"id":"LO1_K-means.pdf#1","file":"LO1_K-means.pdf","content":"Clustering •   Clustering is a form of machine learning where groups, or classes,   are not known ahead of time   so groupings are created by looking   at similar and shared characteristics among the things being grouped.   (homogeneous groups) •   Given a set of potential class members, the task of clustering is to establish the existence of two or more classes or clusters in the members. •   These clusters are often determined through trial and error   by grouping   things together by looking for similar features,   analyzing   the results to see how good they are, and repeating this learning process until the groups are deemed   acceptable. •   Clustering   is an example of   unsupervised learning   because   classes are unknown   at the   start.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   7 What do we need for Clustering? •   Required: 1.   Proximity measure. 2.   Criterion function to evaluate a clustering. 3.   Algorithm to compute clustering.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   8 K - Means Clustering •   K - means   ( MacQueen , 1967)   is a   partitional   clustering algorithm. •   Let the set of data points   𝐷

Use the k means algorithm to cluster them.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   25 ( k - means method) Suppose two clusters are to be formed First assign   a ,   b   and   d   to Cluster 1, Next assign   c and e to Cluster 2. Calculate cluster centroids The cluster centroid is the point with coordinates equal to the average values of the variables for the observations in that cluster calculate the distance between   a   and the two centroids: Centroid of Cluster 1 is   the   point (X1 = 3:67, X2 = 3:67), calculate the distance   between   b and the two cluster centroids: Since   b   is closer to Cluster 2's centroid

Quinlan •   Employs a top - down, greedy search through the space of possible branches (Divide and Conquer) •   ID3 uses   Entropy   a nd   Information Gain   to construct a decision tree.\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   9 Entropy •   Def: -   Entropy is the   Uncertanity   of information that is contained in an Attribute. •   A decision tree is built   top - down   from a root node and involves partitioning the data into subsets   that contain instances(tables) with similar values ( homogenous ). •   ID3 algorithm uses entropy to calculate the   homogeneity   of a sample. •   If the sample is   completely homogeneous   the   entropy is zero   and; •   If the sample is   equally divided   it has   entropy of one .\nwww.belgiumcampus.ac.za   10 Steps. •   Step 1: -   Calculate the Entropy of the target Attribute   𝐸 ( 𝑆 ) •   Step 2: -   Calculate the Average Entropy of each Predictor Variable   𝐸 ( 𝑆 ,   𝑋 ) •   Step 3: -   Calculate The information Gain   𝐼 ( 𝑆 ,   𝑋 ) •

attributes that have a   smaller number of values . •   These ‘Super Attributes’ will easily be selected as the   root node , resulted in a   broad tree   that classifies perfectly but performs poorly

application involves two main stages: compilation and execution.\nExecuting Java Compilation 1)   Source   Code   ( . java) :    The   Java   application   starts   as   human - readable   source   code   files   with   a   \" . java\"   extension .    This   source   code   contains   the   instructions   and   logic   written   by   the   developer . 2)   Compiler   (javac) :    The   source   code   is   then   compiled   using   the   Java   compiler   (javac) .    The   compiler   translates   the   Java   source   code   into   bytecode .    Bytecode   is   a   set   of   instructions   understood   by   the   Java   Virtual   Machine   (JVM) . 3)   Bytecode   ( . class) :    The   output   of   the   compilation   process   is   one   or   more   bytecode   files

platform - dependent,   meaning   there   are   different   implementations   for   Windows, Mac,   Linux,   etc .   but   they   all   adhere   to   the   Java   Virtual   Machine   Specification . 2)   Interpreter   and   Just - In - Time   (JIT)   Compiler :    JVM   loads   the   bytecode   and   the   JVM's   interpreter   reads   and   executes   the   bytecode .    Uses   Just - In - Time   (JIT)   compile   which   dynamically   compiles   bytecode   into   native   machine   code for   the   specific   hardware   it's   running   on,   which   is   much   faster   than   interpreting   bytecode directly . 3)   Native   Code   Execution :    The   JIT   compiler   generates   native   machine   code   specific   to   the   hardware   and   operating   system . 
